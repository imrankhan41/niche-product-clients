            description3:"The tube vs tubeless debate has been raging for a few years now. With the limited options and approach that early tubeless adopters had to deal with when the tech first came to the high-pressure road world, it’s safe to say that team tube inside definitely had the edge. However, as key tyre manufacturers continue to invest in the development of the technology and wheel manufacturers creating wheel options that work well with the tech, the argument for road tubeless is heating up once again. Throughout the test period, I conducted my own mini-experiment, pitting the tubed P Zero VELO clincher tyre with Pirelli’s all-new P Zero SmarTUBE TPU inner-tubes against the P Zero Race TLR to see how they stacked up on price, weight, ease of use and riding impressions.Weight wise the tubed variants tip the scales at 203g, 2g under the manufacturers claimed weight, while the SmarTUBE tipped the scales at a meagre 33g per tube. All told, the tubed set-up weighed in at 236g per wheel, vs 303g for the tubeless set-up (Tyre + Sealant). 70g difference, how did that feel out in the real world? Read on to find out."

            description1:"Released in the latter half of 2020, the Kanzo range of gravel bikes represent Belgian outfit Ridley’s take on the white-hot Gravel scene. With two models in the local line-up to suit both racers and adventurers, we managed to get our hands on the Kanzo Adventure C and set about putting it through its paces to see how it stacks up as a go (almost) anywhere, do-it-all steed.What’s it Cost?: AU$4999.Who’s it For?: Riders in the market for a versatile, carbon framed gravel bike with generous tyre clearance and a sensible geometry.What We Liked: Excellent geometry and build kit, well suited to most terrain.What We Didn’t: The inhouse handlebars aren’t sufficiently flared or suited to technical terrain, overly thick bar tape, and the saddle is more road focussed than we’d like.",

            description2:"At the heart of the Kanzo adventure is a carbon fibre frame that uses Ridley’s high-modulus blend that boasts a reinforced head tube and bottom bracket area to add increased strength and rigidity. A smattering of lugs and bosses for mounting bottles, bags and fenders also feature. Looking at the geometry and with somewhat longer 435mm chainstays and a generous wheelbase across the size range, the Kanzo has stability for days. Add in the taller headtube, somewhat slacker headtube angle and shorter reach, and it’s clear that all-day comfort and adventure riding is a priority here.Aside from the generous amount of mounts on offer across the frame and fork, the other highlight of the frame itself is the generous amount of tyre clearance on offer. With up to 47mm (700C) or 50mm if you prefer to run 650b wheels. Most of this generous clearance is thanks to a revised chainstay area. The front derailleur mount, while not in use here, has been shifted slightly whilst the drive side chainstay dips down immediately after the bottom bracket to provide the room necessary to facilitate the larger rubber.The Kanzo Adventure C retails for AU$4,999, is available in Small - tested (53.5cm) Medium (55cm) and Large (56.5cm) sizes and is claimed to weigh in at 9kg for a Size Medium.",

            description3:"Moving to the specification from the factory and the Kanzo Adventure C that has landed on Australian shores boasts an impressive componentry list that represents excellent value for money. Shimano provides its 1x 11-speed mechanical GRX groupset, which is mated to a mountain bike spec Deore XT 11-42T cassette out back and is driven by a ROTOR Vegast crankset with a direct-mount 42T chainring. The flat-mount hydraulic disc brakes again come from Shimano and are paired with 160mm rotors.Quiver killer bikes aren’t a new thing; the cycling industry is filled with them. From the aero come endurance Cervelo Caledonia to the gravel friendly Paralane from German outfit Focus, there’s no shortage of options on offer. Hell, even the new Diverge gravel bike from Specialized has surprisingly civilised road manners, so when Ridley announced the Kanzo into a stacked adventure bike market, it had some mountains to climb. Rather than shout about its youngest sibling with flashy marketing like its stablemate, the Kanzo FAST, the Belgian outfit has let its product in the talking and in the case of the Kanzo Adventure, it’s saying plenty.In essence, what Ridley has done is release a bike that’s more or less ideal for the majority of riders. Want to dip your toes in the gravel world with some fire road jaunts? It’ll do that all day, thrive on tackling more technical terrain? It’ll swallow that up. Want to use that same bike on your weekend tarmac bunchie? You guessed it, competent here too, and something we frequently did during our time with the Kanzo."

            description1:"After five years in the pro peloton and adorning range-topping bikes and years of speculations when a new groupset would drop, Shimano has finally pulled the curtains back on the latest iteration of its Dura-Ace groupset. However, unlike recent years where a 12-month gap has separated the flagship product from its Ultegra offering, Shimano has boldly released them both at the same time.Yep, two overhauled 12-speed electronic-only groupsets have been unveiled on the same day. There’s a bit to chew through here, but we’re here to cut from the wheat from the chaff and take you through the essentials. Read on for all you need to know about the all-new Shimano Dura-Ace R9200 and Ultegra R8100 road bike groupsets.",

            description2:"With the release of 9200 and 8100, Shimano claims to have made a concerted effort to offer the fastest and most precise shifting groupsets on the market. The heart of this is an overhauled Di2 platform that focuses both on speed and durability. The upgrades centre around an improved motor design within the derailleurs themselves that translates into a 58% decrease in shift speed at the rear derailleur and 45% at the front derailleur. Both Dura-Ace and Ultegra make do with a hybrid wireless system. The shifters are wireless for the first time, whereas Shimano has opted to keep the battery and derailleurs on a wired connection to ensure reliability. The wireless shifters operate with CR1632 coin cell batteries in each shifter and are claimed to have a battery life of one and a half to two years under normal usage conditions.The wired portion of the system has been overhauled, too, with Shimano rolling out a new battery standard and smaller diameter Di2 wires. The new battery is claimed to last 1000km between charges. While this is somewhat less than the 2,000-5,000km between charges for existing R9100 and R8000 Di2 systems, it’s worth noting that the decrease is likely a result of the motor system being a higher output to provide faster, more precise shifts.Shimano has also completely overhauled the system’s brains, with wireless connectivity to the shifters and third party products and system charging duties now handled by the rear derailleur. Moving the connections and Di2 operations such as syncro shifting to the rear derailleur mean that the bar end / under stem junction box and the WU111 wireless unit that currently handles wireless communications are now obsolete. This should make internally wiring the uber integrated bikes of today that little bit easier.",

            description3:"While the Di2 upgrades will likely have the biggest impact on ride feel, the key stat of the new release is the move from 11 to 12-speed shifting for both Ultegra and Dura-Ace groupsets. While the new 12-speed Cassettes feature a new spline configuration, they’re backwards compatible with 11-speed freehub bodies. The move to 12-speed is claimed to be optimised at the 6th, 7th, and 8th, with smoother, more consistent steps in this “sweet spot”. Shimano will offer two cassette options for both groups, an 11-30T and a new 11-34T option for those tackling steeper climbs.In addition to the new cassette’s, the hero centrepiece of each groupset has had an update. Chainring sizes offered include 50-34T and 52-36T, which both Dura-Ace and Ultegra levels will score, while 9200 will also have the option of a whopping 54-40T option for dedicated racers. All three options will be available with an integrated power meter or non-powered at the Dura-Ace level. In contrast, Shimano will offer an Ultegra level power meter option alongside non powered variants in 50-34T and 52-36T configurations for the first time. The revised power meters boast both Bluetooth and ANT+ connectivity, 300 hours of ride time between charges and a claimed accuracy of 1.5%."

            description1:"Are you looking to get started in the world of mountain biking or just after a budget trail shredder to add to your existing bicycle line-up? There are a confusing number of options on offer that represent fantastic value for money.With next years stock beginning to make its way onto showroom floors, we’ve sifted through our picks of the best budget hardtail mountain bikes to be had for under AU$1,500 and made a short hit-list.Hardtails are distinctive as they have a rigid frame and a suspension fork at the front wheel, as opposed to dual-suspension bikes that have suspension in the front and rear of the bike. While gendered frames used to be commonplace at the entry level, most manufacturers are now moving back to unisex designs and colourways. Dual-suspension bikes also exist at this price point; however, we’re yet to find one that is up to the rigours of mountain biking, while the simpler hardtail allows brands to equip the bike better.",

Marin highlights exactly what upgrades can be had with the Bobcat Trail by stretching your budget a little and looking a little left of centre. The Bobcat ships complete with arguably the most capable build kit on this list, with the components of this quality typically found on bikes costing twice as much.With a quality Shimano 1x11 drivetrain, beefy hydraulic disc brakes, meaty tubeless-ready wheels and tyres, a capable 120mm of SR Suntour air suspension up-front, all mated to a quality frameset. The frameset itself is hydroformed aluminium and features routing for a dropper seatpost if you’re looking to expand the scope of this rough and ready ride. Tubeless double-wall aluminium wheels wrapped in 2.25” WTB rubber completes the build.",

            description3:"Priced at AU$1299, the Norco Storm 1 is a big-brand highlight on this list, purely due to the level of the components fitted. Shipping complete with a Suntour XCM HLO DS fork offering up 100mm of travel, with a capable Shimano 1x11-speed drivetrain, this is one entry-level mountain bike capable of tackling some more serious trails.The advantage of an air-sprung fork over their cheaper coil-sprung counterparts is the ability to fine-tune the desired firmness to your weight, making for a more effortless and controlled ride out on the trail. As an extra perk, an air spring is always lighter than a coil.Additionally, the plush Maxxis Rekon 2.25in tyres should provide good levels of traction and roll-over ability, which will help newer riders tackle more demanding trails. Other upgrades for the refreshed Storm 1 include a Shimano Deore crankset paired with an 11-speed Shimano Deore 11-51T cassette and Tektro hydraulic disc brakes. We are impressed with what this bike has to offer for the price. "

            description2:"While the Trance Advanced X was offered exclusively in an aluminium frameset at launch, it didn’t take long for the Taiwanese titans to add a carbon fibre framed range to its versatile trail platform.The change or upgrade in frame material has substantially affected the frame’s weight, with the carbon frame claimed to be a whopping 682g lighter than the standard Trance X alloy range. All told our size Medium test bike tips the scales at an impressive 13.5kg. Other upgrades to the frame over the aluminium variant include titanium hardware at the rocker link, which is said to boost stiffness at the rear swingarm.The geometry remains unchanged from the aluminium model, with the flagship variants scoring the same 65.5º head angle and 77.2º seat angle. The flip chip also carries over, which when, uhh... flipped, increases the bottom bracket height by 10mm and steepens the head and seat tube angles by 0.7º, perfect for those who’d rather focus on pedalling efficiency and technical climbs.Protecting the frame is a generous helping of transparent plastic 3M vinyl on the upper section of the downtube and a mix of moulded rubber at the base of the downtube and bottom bracket area. A ribbed rubber chainstay protector is also in use to protect against chain slap on technical terrain.",

            description3:"Topping the Trance X hierarchy means this steed scores an impressive specification from the factory; we’ll cover the mechanical components below. Still, arguably the show stopper and most significant talking point about this bike is the use of Fox’s LiveValve electronic suspension system.The LiveValve system utilises accelerometers at the front fork and rear suspension to automatically adjust the fork and shock between open and locked out or firm settings. It is said to do this up to 1,000 times a second with a reaction time in three milliseconds. We’ll get into how this tech translates to the real world in our riding impressions below. Still, on paper, this smart suspension tech looks to take the guesswork out of the riding experience and depending on the trails you’re likely to ride, this could be either a boon or a bane.The LiveValve system is paired with a Fox Factory 36 fork up front with a FIT4 Damper and 150mm of travel. At the frame, the system is mated to a Fox Float DPX2 Factory series that’s been fettled with by Fox to accept the new tech."
