From rowdy enduro runs to backcountry missions on steep, chunky singletrack, this new composite 29er builds on the Trance 29 platform with beefed up suspension and adjustable frame geometry.This new member of the Trance family is designed with a longer travel suspension setup for added control on the most challenging trails. The full composite frame is engineered for 135mm of rear travel and 150mm up front. The Maestro rear suspension has a two-stage adjustable Advanced Forged Composite rocker arm with a trunnion-mount shock. The flip-chip equipped rocker arm lets you adjust frame geometry for your own riding style and terrain. To fine tune the ride, you can choose a steeper or slacker headtube angle (66.2 or 65.5 degrees) and seattube angle (77.9 or 77.2 degrees), which results in either a 30mm or 40mm bottom bracket drop. And it’s all built around 29-inch wheels for added stability on rugged terrain..",
